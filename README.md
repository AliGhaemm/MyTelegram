# MyTelegram
my advanced programming project, building a messenger
		In the Name Of GOD

This code is a simple model of a massenger. as other
messengers, you can sign in and log in to it.
here are procedures you may need to work with this
messanger.
from now on, MyT is refered to this messanger.

as in other messangers, you can create a chatroom in MyT
but every type of a chatroom is known as a chatroom.
so you have some chatrooms with different types in MyT.

Every thing you want MyT to do for you is a request.
requests are written as below:

	-@: #

@: can be 'u', 'e', 'edit', 'c', 'm', 'message',
's' and 'see'.

	'u' -> server events like sign in and log in
	'e', 'edit' -> edit events
	'c' -> chatroom events like creating chatroom
	'm', 'message' -> messaging event like sending message
	's', 'see' -> see events like see someone informations

#: can be phrazes below:

	'm' -> "deletemessage", "forwardmessage", "reactonmessage", "replyonmessage", "savemessage", "sendmessage", "delete", "forward", "react", "reply","save","send"
	'e' -> "editbio", "editbirthdate", "editchatroomname", "editdescription", "editemail", "editmessage", "editname", "editpassword"
	's' -> "chatroom", "contacts", "messagereactions", "messagereplies", "myinfo", "sender", "userinfo"
	'c' -> addadmin, addmember, createchatroom, leftchatroom, removeadmin, removemember
	'u' -> login, signin, logout
	
The rest of the procedure is clear.

Thanks for your attention!
